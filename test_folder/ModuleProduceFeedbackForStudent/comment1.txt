Summary of performance
- The student shows clear strengths: good algebra skills, ability to calculate correct answers, and speed in solving problems. These are valuable exam strengths — accuracy and fluency allow the student to attempt many questions.

Data issues to note (please clarify)
- Two records contain impossible scores (37/21 and 28/17) where the Total Marks Attained exceeds the Maximum Total Marks Available. One record is entirely empty. I have prepared the feedback below assuming the qualitative strengths/weaknesses are correct, but please provide corrected numeric scores so I can give more precise grade-target advice.

Strengths (from the papers)
- Algebra: strong, which suggests comfort with manipulation, symbolic work and routine methods.
- Correctness: the student often arrives at the right answer — a sign of good conceptual understanding.
- Speed: solves problems quickly, which is useful in timed exams and means less time pressure.

Main areas for improvement (from the papers)
- Geometry: explicitly noted as a weakness. This often costs marks because diagram-reading, construction, and reasoning require different habits than algebra.
- Showing working: the student loses marks when steps or reasoning are not shown, even if the final answer is correct.
- Handwriting/presentation: poor legibility can cause loss of marks or make examiners unable to award method marks.

Practical, prioritized actions to improve marks
1) Show full method every time: train to write each step clearly and label intermediate results. Practice will turn this into a habit so full working is written even when you’re confident of the answer.
2) Improve presentation and handwriting: spend 5–10 minutes per study session copying neatly written model solutions. In timed practice papers, slow down slightly to make working legible — examiners award method marks based on what they can read.
3) Targeted geometry practice: focus on key geometry topics (angles, circle theorems, triangle properties, coordinate geometry). For each topic, practise 10-15 varied problems and always draw clear, labelled diagrams. Write the reason for each geometric step (e.g., “angles in a semicircle = 90°”, “alternate angles equal”).
4) Use past papers with examiner mark schemes: practise under timed conditions and then mark against the scheme. Pay special attention to where method marks are given — mimic that structure in your answers.
5) Slow down on presentation, not on thinking: because you are quick and usually correct, keep that advantage but allocate the last 5–8 minutes per paper to tidy up and ensure methods are shown and handwriting is legible.
6) Peer or teacher review: have a teacher or peer check one paper each week focusing only on clarity of working and legibility. Small targeted feedback here translates into marks gained.

Concrete short-term targets (next 4 weeks)
- Convert speed + correctness into higher marks by ensuring method is shown on every question: aim to reduce lost method marks by 50% in four timed papers.
- Improve one weaker geometry topic per week and complete 10 focused problems with full working and diagrams.
- Improve handwriting legibility so that all steps are readable by doing 10-minute neat-writing drills three times a week.

If you can: please resend corrected numeric scores (so I can reconcile the impossible totals) and, if available, a sample page showing typical working/handwriting. With that I will give a tailored study plan mapping topics to specific past-paper questions and expected mark gains.
