Summary of the results and data issues
- I reviewed four entries you provided. One entry is entirely empty; two entries contain values where "Total Marks Attained" is larger than "Maximum Total Marks Available" (37/21 and 28/17) which is impossible, and one entry looks consistent (17/25). Because of these inconsistencies I cannot reliably compute overall percentages or an accurate trend from the numbers alone. Please check and re-submit the correct mark totals and maximum marks for marking_result_22.xlsx and marking_result_23.xlsx, and remove the empty record if it was included by mistake.

Brief interpretation of the non-numeric information (independent of data errors)
- Repeated strengths (across papers): good at geometry, good at showing working, and good handwriting. These are excellent foundations: clear presentation and geometric skill both help secure method marks and make answers easier for examiners to follow.
- Repeated weaknesses: not strong in algebra, making calculation errors (getting the right numeric answers), and working slowly on problem solving. These are linked issues: slower pace plus calculation mistakes reduce the chance of finishing and getting accuracy even when the method is understood.

Immediate implications for study and exam technique
- Leverage strengths: continue to present work clearly and keep handwriting neat. Clear structured answers earn method marks even when final arithmetic slips. When working geometry problems, annotate diagrams carefully and show all steps so method marks are captured.
- Prioritise weaknesses: algebra fluency, arithmetic accuracy, and speed. These will increase both correctness and the number of questions answered in timed exams.

Concrete recommendations and action plan
(Short term — next 2 weeks)
- Data: Correct the inconsistent mark entries and resubmit results so targeted tracking is possible.
- Error log: For every practice question, keep a two-column log: (1) what the student did right (method, formula used), (2) what went wrong (calculation error, algebra step, misread). Review this log twice a week to find recurring mistake types.
- Focused drills: 20 minutes/day of algebra basics (manipulating equations, indices, solving simultaneous equations) using progressively harder problems. Emphasise accuracy before speed.
- Mental arithmetic and calculator checks: practice quick checks (estimate/rounding to see if an answer is plausible) and teach a standard checklist for verifying a final numeric answer.
- Timed mini-tests: two 30-minute timed sessions per week on mixed short questions to build speed and exam stamina.

(Medium term — 1–3 months)
- Structured past-paper practice: do at least one full past paper a week under timed conditions. After each paper, do a full error analysis and re-do incorrect items until they are solved correctly without help.
- Algebra progression: move from basic manipulations to coordinate geometry and algebraic problem solving, with attention to common traps (sign errors, factorisation mistakes). Use spaced repetition of key techniques (completing the square, quadratic formula, factorisation patterns).
- Problem-solving strategies: teach the student a toolbox of strategies (draw/label diagrams, consider special cases, work backwards, substitute simple numbers to check reasoning). Practice selecting which strategy to use.
- Exam technique training: practice leaving time at the end of the paper for a quick scan of answers and re-checking difficult arithmetic steps.

(Long term — 3+ months)
- Build automaticity: continued daily short practice for algebra and arithmetic so steps become second nature, freeing cognitive capacity for higher-level problem solving.
- Mock exams and review cycle: monthly full mocks, tracked over time, with targeted revision topics derived from the error log.
- Consider extra support: if algebraic errors persist despite practice, a few sessions with a specialist tutor focused solely on algebraic thinking may accelerate progress.

Practical study tasks and resources
- Create a 6-week plan with daily 20–40 minute focused sessions (algebra drills, calculation checks, geometry practice where student is strong).
- Use short resources: Khan Academy, Cambridge practice problems for 0917 (or syllabus-appropriate past papers), and targeted question banks for algebra practice.
- Use checklists in exams: write key formulas at start, label diagrams, and box final answers. For multi-part questions, write partial results clearly to collect method marks if the final arithmetic is wrong.

How to use your strengths strategically
- Because the student shows good presentation and geometry skills, ensure every answer begins with a clearly labelled diagram (if relevant), a statement of which formula is being used, and a brief outline of the method before detailed working. This increases the chance of securing marks when arithmetic slips.

Suggested immediate tasks to start tomorrow
- Correct the mark data and resend it. If that is not possible immediately, at least provide the correct maxima for marking_result_22.xlsx and marking_result_23.xlsx.
- Start a one-week error log and a short daily algebra drill (20 minutes).
- Do one timed 30-minute question set to assess current speed and types of mistakes.

Final note
- The qualitative patterns you reported (good geometry, neat working; weaker algebra, accuracy, and speed) give a clear path for improvement. Fix the data errors so I can give precise percentage-based feedback and a more tailored progression plan. I'm happy to produce a week-by-week schedule or to analyse corrected marks when you provide them.
