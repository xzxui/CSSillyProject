Students preparing for A-Level exams need to learn by doing past papers and need a way to efficiently have their work assessed in order to improve their exam performance. To serve the purpose of helping students to prepare for their A-Level exams we designed a program that automatically grades a student's work based on multi-modal LLM along with its various other features such as mistakes collection and performance summary.
